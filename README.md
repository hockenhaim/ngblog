# !Empty blog

It's a simple blog with basic CRUD operations and role distributions built with Angular 5 framework and Firebase cloud storage.

## Todo list for the next few days
Fix some bugs with permission system, implement account section and deploy application to Firebase with GitHub.

## Getting Started

To run this project at first you have to install Node and Angular CLI. After that run:
```
npm install
```
in the project root directory. Now you can build the application with:
```
ng serve
``` 
command. Once it done, just navigate to ``` http://localhost:4200/ ```


## Demo

I'll provide it as soon as possible.
